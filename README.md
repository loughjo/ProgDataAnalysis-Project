# ProgDataAnalysis-Project - Bank Loan Status dataset from Kaggle

***

The Project assignment involves researching a Bank Loan dataset. 
There are a number of tasks to be carried out during the research and analysis of the dataset. 

I have included a Juypter notebook that steps through the code and goes through the analysis of the dataset.

Looking at the readme file that comes with the dataset we need to carry out the following tasks :

* Read in the Bank loan dataset
* Check the Bank Loan dataset
* Clean the Bank Loan dataset
* What questions can we ask of the Iris data set
* Univariate Analysis
  * Histograms for each numeric variable
  * Univariate per Class
  * Analyzing the Summary statistics for the 3 Species
  * Histograms per Species/ Class
  * Boxplots
* Bivariate Analysis
  * Scatter Plots
  * Pearson Correlation Coeficient 
  * What further analysis would I like to carry out
* Interesting Analysis of Iris Data set by others
  * Yet Another Iris EDA by Aditya Jetely
  * Iris Dataset - Exploratory Dtaa Analysis by Lalitha Rajesh
* Summary of Analysis

These tasks are outlined in the Juypter notebook.

## How to run the python Code
I hava included an analysis.py which when run will run the code and carry out the following :

* Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file called analysis.txt
* Saves a histogram of each variable to png files
* Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
* Prints out checks on the Iris data set and also Correlation Coefficients
