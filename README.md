# Programming Data Analysis Project 

***

G00388113 John Loughnane. Programming for Data Analysis is a module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in Computing.

## Description of Analysis 
The Project assignment involves researching a Home Loan dataset from the kaggle website. 
The Home Loan dataset contains anonymous data about Loan applications. Each applicant is referencecd by Loan_ID and have 12 variables
related to theie home loan application including whether they were successful or not. This is indicated by the Loan_Status field.
The dataset contains 12 fields with the Loan_Status field beng the dependent variable and the rest of the variables are independent.


The following tasks are required to research and investigate the dataset :

* Read in the Home Loan dataset
* Describe the Home Loan dataset
* Clean the Home Loan dataset
* Explore the Home Loan dataset
* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Simulate the Home Loan dataset
* Conclusion

These tasks are outlined in the Juypter notebook.

The Juypter notebook steps through the code and goes through the analysis of the Home Loan dataset.


## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook can be found on github with the following link :

https://github.com/loughjo/ProgDataAnalysis-Project

The Github repository should contain :

* gitignore
* ProgDataAnalysisProject.ipynb
* README.md
* loan-test.csv
* loan-train.csv
* home_loan_synthesised.csv

You need to download the contents of the ProgDataAnalysis-Project repository to your local machine.
I use Anaconda to run my jupyter Notebooks. It's important when you are running the jupyter notebook that 
the loan-train.csv dataset is in the same directory or otherwise the dataset will not be loaded in when you 
start to run the jupyter notebook.
The jupyter notebook to run is ProgDataAnalysisProject.ipynb which will load up loan-train.csv file.
The home_loan_synthesised.csv file is the synthesised data.
