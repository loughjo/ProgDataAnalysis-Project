# Programming Data Analysis Project 

***

G00388113 John Loughnane. Programming for Data Analysis is a module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in Computing.

## Description of Analysis 
The Project assignment involves researching a Home Loan dataset from the kaggle website. 

Thje following tasks are required to research and investigate the dataset :

* Read in the Home Loan dataset
* describe the Home Loan dataset
* Clean the Home Loan dataset
* explore the Home Loan dataset
* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Simulate the Home Loan dataset
* Conclusion

These tasks are outlined in the Juypter notebook.

The Juypter notebook steps through the code and goes through the analysis of the dataset.


## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook can be found on github with the following link :

https://github.com/loughjo/ProgDataAnalysis-Project

The Github repository should contain :

* .gitignore
*ProgDataAnalysisProject.ipynb
*README.md
*loan-test.csv
*loan-train.csv

You need to download the contents of the ProgDataAnalysis-Project repository to your local machine.
I use Anaconda to run my jupyter Notebooks. It's important when you are running the jupyter notebook that 
the loan-test,csv dataset is in the same directory or otherwise the dataset will not be loaded in when you 
start to run teh juuyter notebook.
